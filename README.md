# infrastructure-general

This monorepo is a centralized place that contains all the code related to infrastructure e.g. scripts, IaC, and Ansible execution code.

We keep Ansible collections and roles [here](https://github.com/ChainSafe/ansible-collection).

## Ansible-Vault Usage for Managing Playbooks

You can encrypt any structured data file used in Ansible, including:

- `ansible_facts`
- A variable file in `host_vars`
- `group_vars` directories
- Variable files loaded by `vars_files`
- `include_vars` keywords within a playbook.
- Variable files passed on the command line using the `-e` option followed by the name of the variable file (for example, `-e @var_file.yml`)

For the sake of simplicity and to avoid naming confusions of new var files, we're keeping all protected variables in the `all.yml` file for each execution repo at this stage of the setup.

### Lunch Playbook with Existing Vault-Encrypted Variables

1. Retrieve the vault password from [1password](https://chainsafesystems.1password.ca/) in **Infra Vault** section (It's a unique password for sensitive information, so do not share it).
2. Launch the playbook with the following command:
    ```bash
    ansible-playbook ./playbooks/desired-playbook.yml -l ${HOST} --ask-vault-pass
    ```
    Use the password provided from `1password`.

### Encrypting New Variables

New variables that need to be protected, can follow these steps:

1. Run the following command:
    ```bash
    ansible-vault encrypt_string --ask-vault-pass 'https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX' --name 'SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL'
    ```
    Enter the new vault password when prompted, ensure it's same password that is set in `1password` for Ansible vault.
2. Copy the result into your vars file. Copy everything from the key name (`SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`) to the end of the long string of encrypted data.
3. Update your vars file with the encrypted variable. The playbook snippet looks like this (truncated for brevity):
    ```yaml
    //all.yml
    ---
    SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL: !vault |
            $ANSIBLE_VAULT;1.1;AES256
            65633138303133363034333734653734383235353564393264326532376433336137363263353837
            6233663762623833393432653438616263396565316365330a376630353530643434653539323834
            ...
    ```
### Decrypting Variables 
 
1. In cases where you need to inspect the content of an encrypted variable, you can verify it using the following command:

```sh
echo '$ANSIBLE_VAULT;1.1;AES256
36663164383665613165366161376364663763646366383235393963393835333966633031616362
3133643836623966646133343738623136616536313834330a636438666362613430333237623666
38306434313064366261666231393034636536396532613136353836396162393962383066363731
3961653162643464300a316562653139383166666538666262323239376364653630643631646334
36303633383063616131356136613162333131346136373339376563633664633934' | ansible-vault decrypt  && echo
```
2. Once the prompt ask for the password, provide the vault password for decryption.
